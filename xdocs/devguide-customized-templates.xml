                This document describes how to create a customizable template.

                    <p>
                        The template feature uses the bin/templates folder which contains :<br/>
                        - templates.xml => file where you declare the templates you want to be able to use<br/>
                        - some .jmx and .jmx.fmkr files which are the templates
                    </p>
                    <p>Here is how it looks like
                    <figure image="template_folder.png">Figure 1 - template folder</figure>
                    </p>

            <subsection name="2 template declaration" anchor="template_creation">
            	<subsection name="2.1 basic template declaration" anchor="basic_template_declaration">
            		<p>
	            		First of all  you must declare your template. To do that, look into the templates.xml file.<br/>
	            		This file respect either a DTD or XSD depending on your JMeter version.<br/><br/>
	            		Below is the already existing Recording template declaration inside the templates.xml :
            			<figure image="templates_xml.png">Figure 2 - recording template declaration</figure>
	            		A template declaration is made as follow :<br/><br/>
	            		- template tag which contains its informations described by the followings tags<br/><br/>
	            		- name tag which contains the template name the user will see<br/><br/>
	            		- fileName tag which contains the relative path of the template.<br/><br/>
	            		- description tag which uses html to describe the template<br/><br/>
	            		- optionnal parameters tag (will be discussed later)<br/><br/>
            		</p>
            	</subsection>
            	
            	<subsection name="2.2 customizable template declaration" anchor="customizable_template_declaration">
            		<p>
	            		Let's think we want the exact same Recording template as in the 2.1 section, but we want to choose the name
	            		of the xml file where will be saved the view result tree results.<br/><br/>
	            		To do so we must use the parameters tag to tell JMeter he has to asks the user about a name for the concerned file :
            			<figure image="templates_xml_parameters.png">Figure 3 - recording template with parameters</figure>
            			<note>You can put as many parameter tags as you want in the parameters tag.</note>
            			Let's see what changed here.<br/>
            			Firstly, customs templates are .jmx.fmkr files and not only .jmx.<br/><br/>
            			Lastly, we added a parameters tag.<br/> As you can see in the image, a parameters tag contains parameter tags.<br/>
            			Parameter tags are empty and contains 2 attributes :<br/><br/>
            			- key is the name of the parameter you will ask the user to choose.<br/><br/>
            			- defaultValue is as its name says, the default value the user will see for the parameter.<br/><br/>
            			
            		</p>

            <subsection name="3 template file" anchor="template_file">
            	<subsection name="3.1 basic template file" anchor="basic_template_file">
            		<p>
	            		The template file is the one you used in the fileName tag when you declared your template.
	            		A template file is just the save of a JMeter test plan.
            		</p>
            	</subsection>
            	
            	<subsection name="3.2 customizable template file" anchor="customizable_template_file">
            		<p>
	            		In the 2.2 section we saw that a custom template file is a .jmx.fmkr file.<br/>
	            		The single difference between them is the .jmx.fmkr will be analyzed by JMeter to<br/>
	            		detect customs tag. If a custom tag is found, JMeter will try to replace it by the corresponding
	            		given value from the user.<br/><br/>
	            		A custom tag is defined as follow : 
	            		<source><![CDATA[[=<key>]]]></source>
	            		Let's illustrate how it works with an example.<br/>
	            		Consider the following part of the recording.jmx template file : <br/>
	            		<figure image="template_recording_filename.png">Figure 4 - recording.jmx save file</figure>
	            		The surrounding area correspond to the name of the xml file where will be saved the view result tree.
	            		As it is, when you use the template you will always have the same saving filename : recording.xml.<br/><br/>
	            		To make it customizable, change your recording template declaration in the templates.xml files by the<br/>
	            		one shown in the 2.2 section. Then, rename the recording.jmx file to recording.jmx.fmkr.<br/><br/>
	            		When it's done, Change the above selected line by this one : 
	            		<source><![CDATA[<stringProp name="filename">[=xmlFileName]</stringProp>]]></source>
	            		<br/>
	            		It's over ! With this configuration, if you chose to use the recording template, JMeter will asks you
	            		a xmlFileName (correspond to the key value in the declaration).
	            		<figure image="template_parameters_window.png">Figure 5 - JMeter asks you the value you want to put for the key</figure>
	            		Then, you will find the expected value in the created template where you placed the [=xmlFileName] tag :
	            		<figure image="template_recording_retrieved_value.png">Figure 6 - the value changed</figure>
            		</p>
